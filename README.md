# OpenCV Image Processing Collection

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of programs demonstrating various image processing techniques using OpenCV. The examples cover fundamental operations such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and more, providing a practical reference for learning and experimenting with image processing concepts.

## Features

- **Blurring**: Techniques for smoothing images and reducing noise.
- **Sharpening**: Methods for enhancing image details and improving clarity.
- **Edge Detection**: Algorithms for identifying boundaries and contours in images.
- **Thresholding**: Techniques for segmenting images based on intensity levels.
- **Morphological Operations**: Operations for image enhancement and noise removal.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opencv-image-processing.git
   cd opencv-image-processing
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install OpenCV**:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

4. **Install other dependencies** (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run a specific image processing script**: Navigate to the folder containing the desired script and run it. For example:
   ```bash
   python blur_example.py
   ```

2. **View results**: The output will be displayed in a window or saved as an image file, depending on the script.
